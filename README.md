- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaximeBergevin, M.Sc, PhD (c) 🎓🧠.
- 🥼 I'm a budding multidisciplinary scientist mainly involved in the fields of behavioural neuroscience and sports. My main aim is to better effort and its perception. I am also interested in the experience of chronic pain, and how it can be managed, especially with non-medical intervention, like physical exercise.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, video games, sports. I also quite enjoy cooking even though I repeatedly prepare the same dish (if only it wasn't for my lazyness to look up new recipees).
- 🌱 Although not an expert, I've become quite comfortable with R. I'd also like to get more comfortable with Python and JavaScript 🐍
